## How Does This Help My Career?
Interacting with the DOM is one of the most fundamental skills for a front-end web developer. Mastering event listeners is essential to creating dynamic user interfaces â€” and to quite a few other things.


## How to play
- Pick your dimension of the artboard
- Hit submit to make your board appear
- Pick any color
- Start making your art "Yyaaaayyy!"

- Used DOM manipulation techniques as createElement and inserting into the pixelCanvas table
- addEventListener to grab the user dimensions
- function to make the grid which includes looping over the desired number of Height and Width while inserting table row and cell into pixelCanvas table element
- Finally created a reset button by using addEventlistener to interact with reset button and used removeChild to reset the game
